title: Music Generation with Neural Networks
---

In this post, we'll examine a few music generating neural networks. We'll present some generated music first, then we'll try to edit the neural networks to see if we can do better.  

My machine uses Intel i5-7500 processor with a GeForce GTX 1070 NVIDIA GPU.
### Initial Results without edits

We start off with results from [Daniel Johnson's]{http://www.hexahedria.com/2015/08/03/composing-music-with-recurrent-neural-networks/}
After 10000 epochs, which took me about 6 hours with GPU acceleration, I got the following:
