# Bipartite check:

A graph is considered bipartite if we can divide the graph into 2 groups of nodes, with the special characteristic that all edges are between the groups of nodes.  
The following graph shows an example of a bipartite graph:

Using the definition of a bipartite graph, we can come up with a way to check if a given graph is bipartite.

We traverse through the graph using either BFS/DFS. As we traverse the graph, we will color each node either red or blue, thus splitting the graph into a group of red nodes and a group of blue nodes.

We can assign the root node an arbitrary color, then run DFS/BFS.
Suppose we are currently visiting a blue colored node. Then we can color all the nodeâ€™s uncolored neighbors red. If the node has any colored neighbors, they must be blue. If we find any neighbors that are colored blue, then the graph is not bipartite.

# Connected components:

We can also use BFS/DFS to identify the connected components of a graph.  
We go through a list of all the nodes in the graph. Whenever we encounter an unmarked node, we will run BFS/DFS using that node as a root. During the traversal of the graph, we mark each node that we come across. When BFS/DFS stops, we have traversed a connected component. Then, we continue iterating through the list of nodes until every node has been marked.

# Flood Fill:

Flood Fill is a simple algorithm that determines the total area connected to a node. This is the algorithm behind the bucket function in paint applications. 

Flood Fill is extremely similar to DFS/BFS. The only difference is that we only add nodes of a certain color to the stack/queue, instead of all neighbors, as in DFS/BFS. We can also keep a counter to count how many nodes we covered.

We leave generating the source code as an exercise to the reader.  
Hint: Start with either BFS/DFS, then modify it.
