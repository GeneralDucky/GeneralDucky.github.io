Dijkstra's Algorithm, invented by famous computer scientist E.W. Dijkstra, is an algorithm used to find the shortest path between 2 points on a **weighted graph**.  
A weighted graph is a graph in which the each edge is associated with a numerical value. Depending on the context, that value can represent the cost of traversing the edge, the length of the edge, etc.  

In Dijkstra's Algorithm,
