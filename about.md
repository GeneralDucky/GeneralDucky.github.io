In this blog, I will discuss various data structures and algorithms, with a strong focus on graph algorithms. I will attempt to go as in depth as possible during my discussions to provide the reader with maximum insight. 

Many of the things that I discuss can be applied to competitive programming competitions such as the United States Computer Science Olympiad (USACO). In addition, I will apply some of the topics that I discuss in the blog to competitive programming questions of varying difficulty. 

This blog is primarily targeted toward people who have a basic grasp of programming (i.e. what one would know after finishin a course like AP Computer Science A) and want to learn more about computer science, as well as people who are interested in competitive programming.
